RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================

The bot is configured to work with Railway automatically.

IMPORTANT SETTINGS:
- The web dashboard will run on the PORT that Railway provides (usually 8080)
- Railway automatically sets the PORT environment variable
- The bot will detect and use this port automatically

ACCESS YOUR DASHBOARD:
https://logiq.up.railway.app/admin

REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN RAILWAY:
- DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = your_bot_token
- MONGODB_URI = ${{MongoDB.MONGO_URL}}  (from Railway MongoDB plugin)
- ENVIRONMENT = production

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you get "Application failed to respond":
1. Check the Railway logs to see if the bot started successfully
2. Ensure the PORT environment variable is set by Railway (it should be automatic)
3. Make sure web.enabled is true in config.yaml
4. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete

PUSH CHANGES:
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Fix Railway port configuration"
git push

Railway will automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub.
